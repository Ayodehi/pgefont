# Ayodehi's OLC PGE Extensions

This repository contains a few extensions that may be of use to developers using
OneLoneCoder's PixelGameEngine (https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

In this initial release, the code is not in a particularly friendly, optimized,
or possibly even correct state. However, you are free to do what you will with it.

The code will be cleaned up and documented in the coming weeks. Feel free to
raise issues and submit pull requests but understand that the code is currently
a work in progress!
